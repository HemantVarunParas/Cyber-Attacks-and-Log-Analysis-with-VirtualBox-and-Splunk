# Simulating Cyber Attacks and Log Analysis with VirtualBox and Splunk

## Objective
The project aimed to create a simulated network attack environment using VirtualBox to connect a Windows 10 VM (victim) and a Kali Linux VM (attacker). The primary goal was to execute an attack and analyze the resulting logs with Splunk to understand attack patterns and enhance network security skills.

### Skills Learned

- **Virtual Machine Management:** Setting up and managing virtual machines using Oracle VM VirtualBox.
- **Penetration Testing:** Using Metasploit for vulnerability exploitation and payload delivery.
- **Malware Creation:** Ability to create and deploy custom malware using 'msfvenom' with a reverse TCP payload.
- **SIEM Log Analysis:** Using Splunk for log ingestion, querying, and analysis to detect and investigate suspicious activities.
- **Command-Line Proficiency:** Executing various command-line tools and utilities on both Windows and Linux platforms.
- **Cybersecurity Concepts:** Understanding of attack vectors, defense mechanisms, and network security best practices.

### Tools Used

- Virtualization Software: Oracle VM VirtualBox
- Operating Systems: Windows 10 (Victim) and Kali Linux (Attacker)
- Security Tools: Metasploit Framework, Nmap, Splunk
- Networking: Internal Network Configuration in VirtualBox
